# IOS_HelloWorld repository contains a mobile ios application with a script implementation in Monkeytalk tool.

The IOS_HelloWorld app repository contains:
- "HelloWorld" folder: This folder contains the XCode project with the files that was programmed in Objective C.

-  "HelloWorldMonkeyTalkProject" folder: This folder contains an automation script programmed in MonkeyTalk tool in order to test this app.
I have used the data source "DataSource.ccv" to parameterize this script.
