# IOS_HelloWorld repository contains a mobile ios application with an automation script implementated in Monkeytalk tool.

The IOS_HelloWorld app repository contains:

- Introduction: This app contains a homepage which displays a user name field, then, when the user enters the username and the "continue" button is clicked, the system redirects the user to another page with a welcome message.
- "HelloWorld" folder: This folder contains the XCode project with the files that was programmed in Objective C.
- "HelloWorldMonkeyTalkProject" folder: This folder contains an automation script programmed in MonkeyTalk tool in order to test this app.
I have used the data source "DataSource.ccv" to parameterize this script.
